# Offset Halving Search Bugfix

## Task Contract

The supplied Verilog-A system violates its public circuit contract. Repair the
complete editable bundle.
The accompanying `solver_contract.json` is the authoritative structured contract.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Preserve the exact declared artifact set, module graph, ports, and dependencies:

- `offset_halving_search.va`: `offset_halving_search`

## Public Parameter Contract

Preserve every public parameter declaration and override behavior in
`solver_contract.json`.

## Required Behavior

The repaired bundle must satisfy every public property:

- `P_INITIALIZE_THE_DIFFERENTIAL_TRIM_RESIDUE_TO`: Initialize the differential trim residue to zero and the active step to `step_initial`. On each falling `clk` crossing before lockout, sample `dcmpp`: a high decision moves the differential trim negative and a low decision moves it positive. Clamp the signed residue to `+/-diff_limit`. Halve the active step after each update; once the next step would be below `step_min`, lock the trim code and hold the existing residue for later clock edges. Drive `vinp` and `vinn` symmetrically around `0.5*vdd` from the current residue.

## Modeling Constraints

- Follow the public modeling constraints in `solver_contract.json`.
- Preserve the exact file set, module graph, ports, parameters, and public traces.
- Do not add debug outputs, validation state, side channels, or stimulus-specific fixes.

## Output Contract

Return the repaired bundle with exactly these submission-root-relative paths: `offset_halving_search.va`.
Every supplied `.va` file is editable; do not add or omit files.
