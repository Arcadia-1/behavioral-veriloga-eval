# Mode Latch Calibration Gate

## Task Contract

Implement the declared behavioral Verilog-A DUT bundle. The accompanying
`solver_contract.json` is the authoritative machine-readable contract.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Submit exactly these artifacts and preserve their declared modules, ports, and order:

- `mode_latch_calibration_gate.va`: `mode_latch_calibration_gate`

## Public Parameter Contract

Preserve every declared public parameter, default, range, and override behavior
from `solver_contract.json`.

## Required Behavior

Satisfy every observable property:

- `P_MEASURE_ANALOG_INPUTS_RELATIVE_TO_THE`: Measure analog inputs relative to the local `vss` rail and normalize by the current local supply span. Let `span = V(vdd, vss)` and treat the row as valid only when `V(en) > vth` and `span_min <= span <= span_max`. If `span` is below `0.05 V`, use `0.05 V` as the normalization span. Define `clip01(y)` as `y` limited to the range `[0, 1]`, `x0..x3 = clip01((V(inN) - V(vss)) / span)`, and `c0 = clip01(V(ctrl0) / vhi)`.
- `P_INITIALIZE_THE_HELD_OUTPUT_FLAG_AND`: Initialize the held output, `flag`, and `metric` to `0 V`. On a rising edge of `clk` or on reset assertion, clear all observables when `rst` is high or the row is not valid. Otherwise, when `c0 > 0.45`, update the held output to `out = vhi * clip01(0.70 * x0 + 0.30 * x1)` and assert `flag = vhi`. When `c0 <= 0.45`, hold the previous output value and drive `flag = 0 V`. After the update or hold decision, drive `metric = vhi * clip01(abs((out / vhi) - x2))`. Hold the last observable values between update events.
- `P_BUILD_A_VOLTAGE_DOMAIN_ANALOG_MIXED`: Build a voltage-domain analog/mixed-signal helper or monitor. Clocked calibration mode latch that gates a held mode value with reset and enable.
- `P_VTH_0_45_V_LOGIC_THRESHOLD`: `vth = 0.45 V`: logic threshold for voltage-coded controls.
- `P_VHI_0_9_V_HIGH_LEVEL`: `vhi = 0.9 V`: high level for output observables.
- `P_SPAN_MIN_0_62_V_SPAN`: `span_min = 0.62 V`, `span_max = 1.28 V`: legal local supply span measured as

## Modeling Constraints

Follow the public modeling constraints in `solver_contract.json`. Keep the model
deterministic, portable to Spectre, and free of evaluator-specific behavior.

## Output Contract

Return exactly these submission-root-relative files: `mode_latch_calibration_gate.va`.
Do not add or omit artifacts.
