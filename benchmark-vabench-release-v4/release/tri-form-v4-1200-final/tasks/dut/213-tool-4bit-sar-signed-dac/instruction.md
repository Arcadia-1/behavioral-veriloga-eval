# Tool 4bit SAR Signed DAC

## Task Contract

Implement the declared behavioral Verilog-A DUT bundle. The accompanying
`solver_contract.json` is the authoritative machine-readable contract.

## Public Verilog-A Interface

Submit exactly these artifacts and preserve their declared modules, ports, and order:

- `tool_4bit_sar_signed_dac.va`: `tool_4bit_sar_signed_dac`

## Public Parameter Contract

Preserve every declared public parameter, default, range, and override behavior
from `solver_contract.json`.

## Required Behavior

Satisfy every observable property:

- `P_ON_EACH_RISING_CROSSING_OF_SH`: On each rising crossing of `sh` through `vth`, evaluate bits `d3..d0` with weights `8, 4, 2, 1`. A high bit contributes the positive weight and a low bit contributes the negative weight. Drive `aout` to the signed weighted sum multiplied by `gain` and hold it until the next sample trigger.

## Modeling Constraints

Follow the public modeling constraints in `solver_contract.json`. Keep the model
deterministic, portable to Spectre, and free of evaluator-specific behavior.

## Output Contract

Return exactly these submission-root-relative files: `tool_4bit_sar_signed_dac.va`.
Do not add or omit artifacts.
